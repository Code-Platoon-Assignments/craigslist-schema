# Craigslist Schema

You are going to design a schema for Craigslist.  Keep it as simple as possible.  If you want to go all in, do that as a second-pass.  You'll probably want to have User, Ad, and Category tables.

Once you have the schema designed and visualized, perhaps using a tool like [Quick Database Diagrams](https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/), you'll implement it following the model of [cars database](https://github.com/echoplatoonew/cars_database).  The `schema.sql` file should contain your table definitions, and `data.sql` will contain some dummy data (2 or three rows per table is fine).  If you don't want to make up the data yourself, you can try [this](https://www.mockaroo.com/).

When you have your postgres container running with your database, write a few queries against it to make sure everything is working.
